ci-cd-pipelines
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment pipeline for Kubernetes using a tool like GitHub Actions, Jenkins or ArgoCD

Prepare a basic Docker image for the application, e.g. a simple Nginx server. Kubernetes deployment manifests. Deploy on Azure (e.g. EKS or Lightsail). Share YAML manifests, CI/CD configurations, and a sample workflow on GitHub.

Project Goal: Create a simple Docker image (Nginx). Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster. Set up a CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions) for automatic deployment when code changes occur.

Environment preparation

Docker Desktop Minikube (for local Kubernetes cluster). Kubectl (for Kubernetes cluster management). Git (for code versioning). GitHub account (for hosting your project).
